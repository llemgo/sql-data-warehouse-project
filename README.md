# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**!  
This project demonstrates the implementation of a modern data warehouse architecture using a multi-layered approach (Bronze, Silver, Gold) to enable efficient, scalable, and insightful Business Intelligence and Analytics.

---

## 🚀 Welcome to the Project

This project showcases a structured pipeline where raw data from enterprise sources like CRM and ERP systems is transformed and curated through multiple layers into business-ready data. The final data layer supports downstream applications such as dashboards, analytics, and machine learning.

##  🏗️ Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e4184d6-a1d1-4e3b-aaa4-ce25bb1095d0)
1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## 📌 Project Requirements: Objective and Specification

### 🎯 Objective

To build a robust and scalable data pipeline that ingests, processes, and serves data for analytical and reporting purposes.

### 📐 Specification

- **Sources**: CRM and ERP Systems  
  - File Type: CSV  
  - Interface: Folder-based ingestion  

- **Data Warehouse Architecture** (SQL Server):
  - **Bronze Layer**: Raw data (no transformations)
    - Load Type: Batch Processing, Full Load, Truncate & Insert
    - Object Type: Tables
    - Data Model: None (as-is)
  - **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and standardized data
    - Transformations: Data cleansing, standardization, derived columns, enrichment
    - Object Type: Tables
    - Data Model: None (as-is)
  - **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data
    - Transformations: Aggregations, business logic, integrations
    - Object Type: Views
    - Data Model: Star schema, flat tables, aggregated tables

- **Consumer Layer**:
  - BI & Reporting
  - Data Analytics
  - Predictive Analytics

---

## 📈 BI, Analytics, and Reporting

The cleaned and business-ready data supports:

- **Business Intelligence**: Interactive dashboards and reports  
- **Descriptive & Diagnostic Analytics**: Trend and pattern discovery  
- **Predictive Analytics**: ML/AI models using historical data  

Tools such as Power BI, Tableau, or Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) can be plugged into the Gold Layer to drive actionable insights.
